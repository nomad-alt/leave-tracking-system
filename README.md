3. **SickLeaveRequest**

   - Extends `LeaveRequest`
   - Specialized medical certificate validation
   - Custom approval logic

4. **Approvable (Interface)**
   - Standardizes approval process
   - `approve()` and `deny()` methods

Employee emp = new Employee(101, "Jane Smith", "HR", 15, 8);

// Create sick leave request
LeaveRequest sickLeave = new SickLeaveRequest(
    1, emp,
    LocalDate.of(2025, 9, 1),
    LocalDate.of(2025, 9, 3),
    "Flu recovery",
    false
);

// Process approval
if (sickLeave.approve("HR Manager")) {
    System.out.println("Leave approved!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Approval failed");
}

// View status history
sickLeave.displayStatusHistory();
```
